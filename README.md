## üéØ Dog Ranking & Sorting

The application implements multiple ways to rank and sort dogs:

1. **Manual Sorting**

   - Users can sort dogs by:
     - Breed (A-Z or Z-A)
     - Name (A-Z or Z-A)
     - Age (1-9 or 9-1)
   - Sorting is implemented using MongoDB's collation for case-insensitive string comparisons

2. **Suggested Dogs Ranking**

   - Dogs are ranked based on a weighted scoring system that considers:
     - Age match (weight: 4)
     - Energy level compatibility (weight: 3)
     - Barking level compatibility (weight: 2)
     - Shedding level compatibility (weight: 2)
     - Compatibility bonuses (weight: 1 each):
       - Good with children
       - Good with other dogs
       - Good with strangers
       - Good with other animals

3. **Match Generation**
   - When generating matches, the system:
     - Randomly selects from user's favorites
     - Ensures no repeat matches
     - Tracks match history per user

Example of sorting implementation:

```typescript
// Sort object for MongoDB query
const sortObj: Record<string, 1 | -1> = {};
if (sort) {
  const [field, order] = sort.split(":");
  sortObj[field] = order === "asc" ? 1 : -1;

  // Add collation for string fields
  if (field !== "age") {
    collation = {
      locale: "en",
      strength: 2, // Case-insensitive comparison
      alternate: "shifted", // Handle special characters
    };
  }
}
```

User Example:

```typescript
// Example user preferences
const userPreferences = {
  ageRange: [2, 5],
  energy_level: 3,
  barking_level: 2,
  shedding_level: 1,
  good_with_children: true,
  good_with_other_dogs: true,
  good_with_strangers: false,
  good_with_other_animals: true,
};

// Example dog matches and their scores
const dogMatches = [
  {
    name: "Buddy",
    age: 3,
    energy_level: 3,
    barking_level: 2,
    shedding_level: 1,
    good_with_children: true,
    good_with_other_dogs: true,
    good_with_strangers: true,
    good_with_other_animals: true,
    matchScore: 12, // Perfect match! (4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1)
  },
  {
    name: "Max",
    age: 6,
    energy_level: 4,
    barking_level: 3,
    shedding_level: 2,
    good_with_children: true,
    good_with_other_dogs: false,
    good_with_strangers: true,
    good_with_other_animals: true,
    matchScore: 7, // Partial match (0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3)
  },
];
```

## üß≠ User Flow

1. **Sign Up**

   - User creates an account with email/username and password.
   - Immediately after signup, the user is redirected to a **survey page**.

2. **Onboarding Survey**

   - New users (or users without preferences) must fill out a survey.
   - The survey collects preferences such as dog size, age range, energy level, barking level, shedding level, good with kids/other animals/strangers, and borough/location.
   - Upon submission, preferences are saved to the backend and the user is redirected to the main dog browsing page.

3. **Browsing & Filtering Dogs**

   - Users see a list of adoptable dogs, filtered or sorted based on their survey preferences.
   - Users can further filter/search using UI controls.
   - Clicking a dog opens a modal with detailed info and a favorite button.

4. **Favorites**

   - Users can favorite or unfavorite dogs, which are saved to the backend and shown in a dedicated section.
   - Users can view all their favorited dogs in one place.

5. **Matching**

   - Users can generate a match from their favorites.
   - The app selects a random favorite dog the user hasn't matched with before.
   - The matched dog is shown in a modal with details and a "Try Again" option.

6. **User Preferences**

   - Users can revisit and update their survey/preferences at any time.

7. **Logout**
   - Users can log out, which clears their session and local data.
